## Tech Stack

In this project, I'm using the MERN stack, which consists of the following technologies:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL document database that provides scalability and flexibility for building modern applications.

- Express.js: A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- Node.js: A powerful JavaScript runtime for building fast, scalable, and cross-platform applications using a single language.
